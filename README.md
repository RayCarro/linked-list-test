# Linked List test

The container class is in `linkedlist2024.h`, the tests are in `linkedlist2024.cpp`. I wasn't sure if I'm allowed to use 3rd party libraries, so I didn't use a testing library.

To compile and run just do `cmake . && make && make test` or just check the results in Github Actions.
